    <p><!--This opening tag-->
        This tag help us to create a paragraph but there are so many tag which we use to edit the paragraph like if I have to breake this line from her I will use br tag to break the line bsically this work as \n <br>and as I said, and now I want to make my name username bold here so I will use Bold tag which this <b>monukd01dev</b> we have and alternate also which is people currently using to bold cause is make more sence which is storng tag <strong>monukd01dev</strong>. Now I will make my name italic using i tag and em tag basically they both do the same thing but the current one is em <i>monukd01dev</i> and for em is <em>monukd01dev</em> again a br <br>now we use SuperScript like E=MC^2 formula not using SuperScript and E=MC<sup>2</sup> using SuperScript basically everything you'll put inside the sup tag will go up from the mid line of text and if you want to place the text down from the midline of text  we use SubScript, like if we want to write the formula of water we write like this H<sub>2</sub>O. And its time to see the mid line of text using the del tech <del>monukdo1dev</del> and <s>monukd01dav</s> and the next tag we gona use is hr tag which create a horzontal line.
